### File Structuring

- **DataSet**: Include all `.csv` files. Also, find the `LCDataDictionary.xlsx` file for column information.
  - **Note**: After adding any dataset, review the `.gitignore` file to avoid committing large datasets.

- **RMarkDownHTML**: Folder for all `.Rmd` files. Please work in this folder.

- **RMarkdownHTML**: Folder to store all HTMLs knitted from `.Rmd` scripts.

- **RMarkdownHTML/readMe.md**: Once you complete an HTML answering a SMART question, document it in `readMe.md` with the purpose of that HTML and your name. This will help in navigating and compiling a single HTML later. Use [Markdown Live Prieview](https://markdownlivepreview.com) to see a preview before commiting.

### Git

- Each collaborator should create their own branch from the main branch with the branch name in the format `LastName-FirstName` to facilitate easy merge requests.

- Before making changes, check if anyone else is working on the same file. It's best for each person to work on a separate file. After completing your work, push your branch. Once reviewed, we can merge it into the main branch to avoid merge conflicts.
